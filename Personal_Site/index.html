        <p class='info'>
            After 3 months in Frem's, you're finally starting to understand your
            new life as a scraper. Your work for the local tribes helping find
            items and hunting. Something is changing though, new creatures are
            appearing throughout the mall. If you don't find a way out soon, it
            will soon be too much.

        <h4>The mall</h4>
        <p class='info'>
            The mall has no exit. The locals have tried everything they can to
            escape. But the walls are nothing if not indestructible. The mall,
            however, is stocked with anything you could ever want. "Employees"
            periodically restock the parts of the mall, so you'll never run out
            of goods.

        <h4>The "employees"</h4>
        <p class='info'>
            The employees are the biggest threat of Frem's. No-one knows where
            they come from, but they never seem to end. In fact, there are
            more of them than ever before. To you and as well as any other
            tribes, they are extremely hostile. It's up to you to work around
            them. The customer isn't always right here.
