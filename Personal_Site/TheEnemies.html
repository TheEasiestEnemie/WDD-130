            <h4>The Cashier</h4>
            <p>
                The first line of Employees. There are always at least half a dozen
                in each store. They walk their store and man the registers.
            </p>

            <h4>The Restocker</h4>
            <p>
                The restocker stocks the shelves of each store. They get their
                goods from the warehouse, and can be seen traveling through the
                halls and in the stores. Sometimes if they are carrying
                something valuable, they will be escorted by Security.

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>
                Hulking, violent, and fast, these behemoths guard the high
                profile restockers and patrol the higher end storefronts like
                the gun and jewelry store. They are very hard to kill.

            <h4>The Manager</h4>
            <p>
                The manager watches off the Office and occasionally goes out to
                find the player by the use of the security cameras. They will make
                their presence known, and head to the players last known location.
                The other employees, even Security, hide from the Manager.
            </p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Warehouse Man</h4>
            <p>
                He is the sole worker of the warehouse. There is a reason he is the
                only one. He is the equipment, Security, and Manager combined. Not
                even the Manager dares step into the warehouse.

            <h4>The Mechanic</h4>
            <p>
                The Mechanic fixes broken security cameras throughout the store.
                They also set up traps to catch/kill the player.
