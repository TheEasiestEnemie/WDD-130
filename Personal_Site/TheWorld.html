    <h4>Layout</h4>
        <p>
            The mall is full of shops containing all the things you need from
            body armor to apples. There are several of each type of store
            throughout the mall, some bigger than others. There are several floors
            within Frem's, of which travel can be made easier through the use of
            hooks and ropes.

    <h4>Employees in Their Place</h4>
        <p>
            How good the goods are is equal to what's guarding it; from simple
            cashiers to monstrous security. Each employee patrols it's respective
            area, it is just doing its job after all.

            You're not the only one stuck in the giant mall, dozens of others have
            fallen prey to Frem's, some coming long before your time. Not all of
            them see eye to eye, and as such have waged war on eachother as well as
            the employees. You'll have to play the ambassador for different factions
            or work alone; your choice.
